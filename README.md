# Twinder Quiz Team Project

##### :clock1130: Date:

November 2021

##### :muscle: What was my motivation?

Twinder was a second team project created during education at Hyper Island. Initially, our idea was to let people make the quiz and compare the answers to match them as in Tinder. Due to a very short deadline, we managed create the questions and store them in Firebase, as well as set the Authentication.

##### :books: What did I learn?

Since we haven't been presented the single-page apps by that time yet, we created a bunch of HTML pages with CSS so it was a kind of training on how to template. With a help of the Industry Leader, tutorials, classmates and documentation I managed to set the Authentication in Firebase and managed to set up the Database. 

##### :flashlight: How to use the project?

Unfortunately, the results of the project won't be compared so you will be matched with our Program Manager by default by now. My database is already expired, so I believe that the Authentication will not work probably too.
